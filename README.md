```
Js_of_ocaml is a compiler of OCaml bytecode to Javascript. It makes it possible
to run Ocaml programs in a Web browser.
```
and from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocsigen) describing
the Ocsigen project:
```
A Javascript compilator from OCaml to Javascript named js_of_ocaml. It makes it
possible to run OCaml programs in a Web browser, with portability and without
having to install anything. The compilator takes as input language an OCaml
bytecode, that is a compiled OCaml program. It allows you to use existing OCaml
libraries whose source code isn't available.
```

## How does it work ?

After learning how to compile an ocaml file into a Javascript file, a Makefile
will be available for each next exercices (see [this
